               I am a creative and self-starting Front-End Developer with more than 1-year experience building and maintaining responsive websites in fast-paced, collaborative environments. Proficient in HTML / CSS / JavaScript / JQuery / React ; plus modern libraries and frameworks. Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. The list of projects contained in my portfolio will give you a good idea of the level of my knowledge.
